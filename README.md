This is a repository to brush up C skills if you haven't written code in a long time (think decade).
Some of the programs and functions are taken directly from the book "The C Programming Language", Second Edition by K&R.

Programs are written and compiled on Debian 7.0 (64-bit) Linux machine using GCC compiler:
- Linux debian60-vm 3.2.0-4-amd64 #1 SMP Debian 3.2.46-1 x86_64 GNU/Linux
- gcc (Debian 4.7.2-5) 4.7.2
